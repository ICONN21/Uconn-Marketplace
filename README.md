## Description
UCONN Marketplace is an interactive web application designed to facilitate a community marketplace where users can list items for sale and mark others as favorites. It follows the MVC architectural pattern and leverages Node.js, Express, and Sequelize ORM with a PostgreSQL database. The platform allows users to register and log in to access personalized features such as posting items for sale, browsing items listed by other users, and managing a list of favorite items.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 12 or higher recommended)
- PostgreSQL

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ICONN21/Uconn-Marketplace
   cd UCONN-Marketplace

## Usage 
After installing and starting the server, navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access UCONN Marketplace. Users can register or log in to their accounts to access the following features:

. Home Page: Upon login, users are directed to the home page where they can navigate to various sections of the application.

. Post Page: Users can add items to the marketplace by specifying details about the item.

. Browse Page: View all items posted by users across the platform. This section allows users to interact with posts, either by liking them to save to their favorites or contacting the seller.

. Favorites Page: Users can view a list of items they have liked from the browse page, allowing them to keep track of their favorite items easily.

## Future Development

In the future, UCONN Marketplace plans to expand with the following features and improvements:

- **Enhanced Security Measures**: Implementing advanced security protocols to ensure user data protection and secure transactions.
- **Mobile App Version**: Developing a mobile application to provide users with the convenience of accessing the marketplace on their smartphones.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Adding real-time notifications for users about updates to their posts or activities on items they've shown interest in.
- **User Rating System**: Introducing a user rating system to foster trust and transparency among the marketplace community.
- **Purchase Functionality**: Implementing a system that allows users to directly purchase items through the website, enhancing the marketplace's functionality as a complete e-commerce solution.
- **More Payment Options**: Expanding payment options to include more gateways and perhaps cryptocurrency transactions.
- **Messaging System**: Developing a feature that enables users to message each other directly through the platform to discuss meeting up or shipping details for exchanging items.

These enhancements are aimed at improving user experience, accessibility, and overall functionality of the marketplace.
